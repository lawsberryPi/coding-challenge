##### Shawn's solution for Ambassador Coding Challenge
#### Code Discription

###	Description of the problem and solution.
* This problem is a typical CRUD problem, user can manage their referral links using this portal easily. 
  -The api need to be able to handle HTTP GET, POST and DELETE requests.
  -The front end should be intuitive, responsive and be able to perform table sorting. 
  -The back end should be able to handle create, read, update and delete operations.
  
-	Whether the solution focuses on back-end, front-end, full stack, or mobile.
  - The solution is focuses on full stack.
  
-	Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architecture.
  - Front end: I chose React & Redux which is recommanded by Ambassador, and I am also pretty familar with it. On top of it, I used Material UI to create beautiful and responsive UI. I really like react and react & redux, because they makes the state predictable
-	Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project.
-	Link to the hosted application (where applicable).

This will give us insight into how you approached the challenge.

#### Deployment

https://shawn-code-challenge20190509092616.azurewebsites.net/ is my link, I have deployed on Azure. The reason is I had no time to learn deploy ASP.NET core on Heroku; This week was not a good week for me,
we have a Ford vice president level leader to visit our team, and we had to perform a demostration, I had a lots of overtime, so I had no time to learn Heroku deployment.

## Show us your other projects! (optional)
a website I am trying to build for my fiance, just started it.
